# VibeIDE

**The AI agent terminal orchestrator for vibe coders.**

Run Claude, Gemini, Aider, and 9 more AI agents side by side — in split panes, with voice input and git worktree isolation.

## Features

- **12 AI agents** — Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, Aider, OpenCode, Cline, Copilot, Amp, Continue, Cursor, Crush, Qwen
- **AI Skills integration** — install pre-packaged coding standards, TDD workflows, security patterns, and agent definitions during onboarding
- **Multi-project management** — sidebar with project groups, status badges, instant switching
- **Git worktree isolation** — each agent works in its own branch, review and merge with one click
- **Smart status detection** — knows when agents need input, complete, or errored
- **Toast notifications** — configurable sound, toast, and desktop alerts per event type
- **Voice input** — push-to-talk dictation (F3) and voice commands (F4)
- **File viewer** — CodeMirror 6 with syntax highlighting, git diff, pop-out to separate window
- **Source control** — commit graph, changes list, stage/unstage/discard
- **Command palette** — fuzzy search, context-aware filtering, agent-specific commands
- **Launch Workspace** — guided setup: pick project, choose agents, select layout, launch
- **Copy-paste** — smart Ctrl+C (copies if selected, SIGINT if not), right-click context menu
- **12 themes** — 9 dark + 3 light (Tokyo Night, Dracula, Nord, Solarized, GitHub, Catppuccin, etc.)
- **Session persistence** — layout, agents, and scrollback restored on relaunch
- **First-run onboarding** — guided wizard: detect agents, install AI skills, select project

## AI Skills

VibeIDE bundles pre-packaged skills from the [AISkills](https://github.com/NandaDevaiah/AISkills) repository. During onboarding (or later from the command palette), you can install:

- **Coding standards** — universal best practices, language-specific rules
- **TDD workflow** — test-driven development with 80%+ coverage enforcement
- **Security scanning** — AI regression testing, vulnerability detection
- **API design** — REST patterns, status codes, pagination, error responses
- **Agent definitions** — planner, code reviewer, security reviewer, architect, TDD guide
- **Language rules** — TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Kotlin, Java, Swift, C++, PHP, Perl

Skills are installed to each agent's config directory (`~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.gemini/rules/`, etc.) so your agents are effective out of the box.

## Install

### Linux

## Quick Start

1. Open VibeIDE — the onboarding wizard detects installed agents
2. Install AI Skills (recommended preset or custom selection)
3. Add a project directory
4. Click **+** on a project to spawn an agent, or use **Launch Workspace** (sidebar play button) for multi-agent setup
5. Agents run in isolated git worktrees — review and merge changes when done
