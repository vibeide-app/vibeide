## Product Goals

### Goal 1: Multi-Project Agent Orchestration

Be the first tool that lets vibe coders manage 3-7 projects with multiple AI agents each in a single window.

- **Phase 1 (Electron MVP)** — current
  - [x] Project-centric sidebar with collapsible project groups
  - [x] Agent list grouped under projects (not flat)
  - [x] Traffic-light status rollup per project (green/yellow/red/blue)
  - [x] Notification badges for unread events per project
  - [x] Instant project switching (pre-rendered in background)
- **Phase 2 (Native Rust)**
  - [ ] Port sidebar to native UI (egui/iced overlay)
  - [ ] Background state tracking for inactive projects
  - [ ] Overview mode — thumbnail previews of all project workspaces

---

### Goal 2: Agent-Aware Terminal Panes

Every pane surfaces real-time agent state so the user never reads raw output to know status.

- **Phase 1 (Electron MVP)**
  - [x] Agent status strip per pane: type, status, elapsed time
  - [x] Status states: running, idle, needs-input, error, complete
  - [x] "Needs input" amber/yellow urgency indicator
  - [x] Auto-detect agent type (Claude, Codex, Gemini) with branded icons
  - [x] Kill button per agent
  - [x] Agent-specific needs-input detection:
    - [x] Claude Code: detect permission prompts ("Allow", "Approve", tool use approval, plan confirmation)
    - [x] Claude Code: detect "Do you want to proceed?" and similar prompts
    - [x] Gemini CLI: detect input prompts and confirmation requests
    - [x] Codex: detect approval/confirmation patterns
    - [x] Detect agent waiting for user response (blocked state)
    - [x] Parse ANSI-styled prompts (colored/bold text in agent output)
  - [x] Configurable notification sounds per event type (needs-input, complete, error)
  - [x] One-click jump from sidebar notification badge to the specific agent terminal
  - [x] In-app toast notifications (top-right corner, 5s auto-dismiss)
  - [x] Per-event notification preferences UI (visual/sound/focus-steal toggles)
  - [x] Agent installation detection and guided install:
    - [x] Check if agent CLI is available on PATH before spawning (claude, gemini, codex)
    - [x] If not installed, show install prompt with instructions and install command
    - [x] Link to official install docs for each agent
    - [ ] Detect installed version and show in agent status bar
    - [ ] Auto-detect newly installed agents (periodic PATH check)
- **Phase 2 (Native Rust)**
  - [ ] GPU-rendered status overlays
  - [ ] Structured tool-call cards (Warp-style blocks)
  - [ ] OSC 133 shell integration for block-based output
